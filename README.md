# twitter_sentiment_challenge


##Overview

This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analyzer challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #2' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. We'll be able to see how positive or negative each tweet is about whatever topic we choose.

##Dependencies

tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)

textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)

Install missing dependencies using pip

##Usage

Once you have your dependencies installed via pip, run the script in terminal via

  python sentiment_analyzer.py
